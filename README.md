### Hello Everyone 😀

I'm a FullStack developer working at [UP IT Services](http://upitservices.com.br). I really love coding *(even more when they work* 😂 *)* and sometimes it's easy to see me coding just for fun. I've been working a lot with PHP, Python, Java, VueJS, Angular and other technologies.

I've been fighting cancer for the 2nd time now and I'm really proud for win this fight both times. I really like to tell people about my story and help them when they´re in difficult situations like this.

Oh, and I was forgetting: I love to play guitar 🎸 and sing. (Even though I'm far away from being a good singer 🤦🏻‍♂️)
